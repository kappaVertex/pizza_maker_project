# The maestro pizza maker wants to fully understand of the properties of his pizza menu.
# Therefore he defines the follwing variables in the pizza industry known as "pizza sensitivities":
# 1. menu_sensitivity_protein - represents the rate of change between the price of the pizza and the amount of protein in the pizza
# 2. menu_sensitivity_carbs - represents the rate of change between the price of the pizza and the amount of carbohydrates in the pizza
# 3. menu_sensitivity_fat - represents the rate of change between the price of the pizza and the amount of average_fat in the pizza

# TODO: implement above mentioned sensitivities
# hint: simple linear regression might be helpful
